Alchemize - Simple de/serialization for Python
===============================================

Alchemize is designed to be a simple serialization and deserialization
library for Python. The primary use-case for Alchemize is to allow for
users to quickly build ReST clients using simple model mappings to
transform data from Python objects to a serializable form and vice-versa.

The power of Alchemize is that you can use it to augment existing
model structures from other libraries. For example, you can use Alchemize
to easily serialize your ORM models.
