Welcome to Alchemize's documentation!
=====================================

Alchemize is designed to be a simple serialization and deserialization
library. The primary use-case for Alchemize is to allow for users to
quickly build ReST clients using simple model mappings to transform
data from Python objects to a serializable form and vice-versa.

The power of Alchemize is that you can use it to augment existing
model structures from other libraries. For example, you can use Alchemize
to easily serialize your ORM models.
